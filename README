DESCRIPTION
	Simple management cli for tracking tasks. 

        This interface wraps a file using the simplest possible format
        where each task is represented as a single line of text in
        the file.

        Each task has an id of its line number in the file.

        Task ids are ephemeral, so as tasks are completed, added or
        prioritised the id will change. The id is primarily for interactive
        use.

        By default the file is stored as '.task' in your current directory.
        This default can be overridden with the TASK_FILE variable.

             TASK_FILE=~/.task task l

        It is standard practice to utilise two aliases for task. One 
        representing a task file in your current directory, and one representing 
        a global task file in your home directory. The current convention for 
        these aliases is `x` for the local instance of task, and `xx` for the 
        global instance of task.

                alias x=task    
                alias xx="TASK_FILE=$HOME/.task x"

STATE
        The tool is stable and in use. No major changes are expected.

LIMITATIONS
        The tool is intentionally limited. Less yaks, more action.
